This is just a fixed-size, templated, 2D array without any numeric operations and boundary checking. This is useful when passing 2D data to a function. However, if it's not what you are looking for. For a fully functional matrix on linear algebra, see [uBLAS of Boost](https://www.google.com/search?q=boost+ublas). For a higher dimension array, see [MultiArray of Boost](https://www.google.com/search?q=boost+multiarray).

## Usage

Download the [`matrix.h`](https://raw.github.com/YiPo/cpp-simple-matrix/master/matrix.h) file and include it. No library is needed to be linked.
